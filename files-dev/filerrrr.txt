I am using gulp-karma and facing a simple problem but cannot seems to find what i am doing wrong .

gulp.task('test', function (done) {
    karma.start({
        configFile: __dirname + '..\\test\\' +'\karma.conf.js',
        singleRun: true
    }, done);
});

Here is the code i am using and i cannot seems to go 1 level back in the folder directory . When i do the above it just append the ..\ to the folder direcotry without going 1 level back (which is the usual use of ..\). Following is the folder structure .
